# Agglomeration

A simple tool for organizing users into groups. Agglomeration was created to combat the feeling of isolation when working on a large team of remote workers. A truly effictive team is more than just having the right people in the right places. There are less tangible attributes that
are just as important to the overall success. One of those items is finding common connection points with team members in order to build relationships.
Cultivating bonds of this nature can be very difficult when there are no cafeterias or water coolers to gather around. Agglomeration hopes to help get these important connections off the ground by providing a quick menu system to search team memebers by department or name. It also provides quick access to a users contact information and personal notes.


## Getting Started

Agglomeration has two types of users, those that are admin and those that are not. Before starting the app one admin account must exisit in the database.
The initial admin account will be responsible for setting up the stage in which Agglomeration users will interact.

Admin initial set-up steps:

0. Log in.
1. Create departments for user assignment.
2. Create intial user profiles for all admin and non admin accounts.
3. Enjoy the app.

User privilages:

Admin users have enhanced privialges and site access. Admin users can view, create, edit, & delete all other user profiles and department categories.
Non Admin users have privailates to view other users and edit their user profile.

Sample users for app testing:

Admin account: ffuego@app.com password: password

Non Admin account: mturner@app.com
         password: password
